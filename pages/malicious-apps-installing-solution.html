A malicious app silently download and install other malicious apps without user permission so you just needs to find that malicious app. Malicious app can also be on Google Play as well as from unknown sources. Because you can't detect which app is malicious you have to follow the following security tips.
<br/>
1.Uninstall all the unnecessary apps. (the apps you have some doubt on them)
you can get the list of all apps here Setting > Apps > Downloaded
<br/>

2. Restrict background data/wifi access of all apps except (Facebook, whatsapp, twitter, google play and all common apps)
<br/>
because malicious apps use background data/wifi to download other malicious apps/ads and upload your data (logs, passwords, pics etc) to the hacker. So by restricting of background internet usage malicious apps can not download/upload secretly.

Setting > Data usage > select each app one by one you want restrict > scroll down > check "Restrict Background Data".
<br/>

3. Install an advance firefall from google play (check the rating and reviews while selecting one) and create rules which app can access internet.
<br/>

A malicious app can be more dangerous than your thinking. It can secretly record your video and can take pictures from your front and back camera without your knowledge it can also record your passwords, can leak your contacts, can read your whatsapp and much more you can't imagine.
